# CaseStudies
Case studies taken up in the Machine Learning course pursued at  Decodr Technologies 

Each case study has been uploaded as a zip file and the zip file contains the Jupyter ipynb code file and the corresponding dataset.

1.Country dataset contains unsupervised learning algos for identifying, based on socio economic factors, which nations are in dire need of aid & identifying through clustering algos countries with healthy and unhealthy lifestyles.

2.Housing Project : deals with regression models.Aim of project is To predict the price of houses with the available independent variables. 
To build a regression model  in order to arrive at a prediction. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. 
the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market. Linear, Ridge and Lasso Regression models used and compared to arrive at best model.

3.MovieAssignment is an assignment based project with data for the 100 top-rated movies from the past decade along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online, has been provided. In this assignment, it is attempted  to find some interesting insights into these movies and their voters, using Python.

4.Uber analysis. The project involves a dataset pertains to Uber rides in July 2016 . It is a study in Exploratory Data Analysis and Data visualisation to analyse the various factors impacting the bottomline of the service provider and providing suggestions/ improvements that could be effected, based on the analysis.

5.Power plant project : The project consist of a dataset contains 7176 observations and 5 features of a power plant set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) being independent feature and net hourly electrical energy output (EP) being target / to be predicted feature. The linear regression model has been used in the project.

6.Black Friday Sale Project:  A retail company wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products for a period. The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from the corresponding period
The objective is to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.

7.Aviation Accident Project  This project is meant to explore, analyse and visualize aviation accidents and related factors
such as fatalities based on various parameters Detailed analysis of following factors a)The planes crashed per year b)People aboard per year during crashes c)People dead per year during crashes d) Fatalities versus various features of dataset.

8.Haberman Survival Analysis: This project aims at the univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis by extensive use of Data Visualisation.The objective is  study of the survival based on the factors affecting survival & to predict whether the patient will survive after 5 years or not based upon the patientâ€™s age, year of treatment and the number of positive lymph nodes.

9.Iris dataset : The dataset deals with the various properties of the flowers and then classifies them according to their properties.
It involves predicting the flower species given measurements of iris flowers.It is a multi-class classification problem. 
The number of observations for each class is balanced. There are 150 observations with 4 input variables and 1 output variable ie Species.. The variable names are as follows:
a)Sepal length in cm. b)Sepal width in cm. c)Petal length in cm.d)Petal width in cm. e)Species (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, Iris Virginica).

10. Credit Card Fraud Detection:Companies suffer losses due to fraudulent activities, many companies worldwide have lost billions of dollars yearly. This project aims to use the combination of fraud and non-fraud transactions from the historical data with different people's credit card transaction data to estimate fraud or non-fraud on credit card transactions. It is a  supervised learning -classification exercise and two models have been employed and imbalance in data addressed through over under & over sampling, to arrive at the best possible classification.
