# CaseStudies
Case studies taken up in the Machine Learning course pursued at  Decodr Technologies 

Each case study has been uploaded as a zip file and the zip file contains the Jupyter ipynb code file and the corresponding dataset.

1. Country dataset contains unsupervised learning algos for identifying, based on socio economic factors, which nations are in dire need of aid & identifying through clustering algos countries with healthy and unhealthy lifestyles.
2. Housing Project : deals with regression models.Aim of project is To predict the price of houses with the available independent variables. 
To build a regression model  in order to arrive at a prediction. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. 
the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market. Linear, Ridge and Lasso Regression models used and compared to arrive at best model.
